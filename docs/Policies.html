						CL Defense LLC is located at 104 W Oak St, McRae, GA 31055, just down from Harvey's. However, we do have actual jobs outside of this, so when you call us you may not get us, but we will do our very best to get back with you. The best way to reach us is by cell (Chris) 229-860-1440, (Lamar) 229-315-1721, or (email) cldefensellc@gmail.com.
					</li>

					<li>
						We do trade guns, but we will not entertain any trade offers outside of the shop.
					</li>

					<li>
						We accept cash, credit/debit, and USPS Money Orders as payment. After you have purchased from us on two occasions, we may accept a personal check.
					</li>

					<li>
						We cannot meet you anywhere to sell a gun, so please don't ask. Per ATF rules, all transfers must be done on our premises or at a gun show. And unless your ammo/accessory purchase is uncharacteristically large, we will not meet for that either, unless we happen to be headed that way anyway. If the ATF would allow us to be mobile FFL dealers, we could quit our real jobs.
					</li>

					<li>
						All firearm purchases will be done legally. You must fill out a Form 4473. If you don't have a GA Firearms License or a GA Weapons Carry License, then you must pass a FBI NICS background check. If you cannot pass the check, then we cannot transfer you the firearm.
					</li>

					<li>
						We do our very best to price our guns as low as possible. We are usually lower than most everywhere else and our margin on most firearms is small. Our posted price is usually our bottom-line price. Don't ask us if we will take $300 cash out the door for a gun that has been posted at $350 + tax. You wouldn't walk into Wal-Mart or Home Depot or Dairy Queen and do that. (Well, you might, but you probably wouldn’t be successful).
					</li>

					<li>
						We do not test-fire our guns. All of them are NEW IN BOX unless otherwise stated. I don’t know of very many, if any, dealers that test-fire their guns. In my opinion, if we test-fire a gun, it then becomes a USED gun.
					</li>

					<li>
						We transfer guns you purchase online or elsewhere as well. Transfers are $25 for handguns and long guns, Suppressors $75, Machine Guns/Other NFA Items $100. Public Safety Transfers are FREE. We also special order if the gun you want is available from one of our distributors, but non-refundable payment must be made IN FULL and background check completed before an order will be placed.
					</li>

					<li>
						We are an SOT (sometimes called a Class III Dealer). We sell and facilitate the transfer of NFA items such as suppressors/silencers, machine guns, short barreled rifles/shotguns, etc. Understand that the transfer of these items is a drawn out process with several government hoops to jump through. For example, the time frame from start to finish for a silencer is currently 6-10 months. For that reason, all NFA items require 100% payment up front.
					</li>

					<li>
						We appreciate everyone's business and support and we want to offer quality firearms to quality people at reasonable prices. We apologize for being an hour and a half away, but personally we would rather drive 110 miles to save, in some cases $100-150 dollars, on an AR or a Glock. You may not agree, but some will. Sorry if any of this offends anyone, but we just wanted to pass along some information.
