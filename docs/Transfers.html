					<h4>Why do I need to use an FFL to transfer a firearm?</h4>
					
					<p>
						Certain transactions involving firearms, including most that send a firearm across state lines, must be handled through a Federally-licensed firearms dealer (FFL). If you buy a firearm online, in most cases it must be shipped to an FFL for transfer to the purchaser
					</p>
					
					<h4>How do I transfer my purchase?</h4>
					
					<ol class="TransferSteps" type="A">
						<li>Find a seller of the firearm that you want.</li>
						<li>Contact us to determine if we can assist you with your transfer.</li>
						<li>Work out all details of the transaction with the seller.<br>
						<span id="Description">This includes price, shipping terms, and payment method, with the seller of the firearm. In addition, ask about the condition of the firearm, and what accessories are included.</span></li>
						<li>Contact us and let us know that the transaction with the seller is complete, as well as the contact information for the seller (email, phone, fax).</li>
						<li>We will provide a copy of our Federal Firearms License (FFL) to the seller. </li>
						<li>The seller will then ship the firearm to us.</li>
						<li>We will notify you when the firearm has arrived.</li>
						<li>Complete the necessary paperwork.</li>
					</ol>
						
						<p>
							You will need to meet us at our business location, where you will complete ATF Form 4473.  Next we will use the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to determine if we are allowed to transfer the firearm to you. If we receive authorization to transfer the firearm, we will. (Buyers who are in possession of a valid Georgia Weapons Carry License are not subject to the NICS check.)
						</p>
										
						<p>
							<span id="Note"><span id="NoteU">NOTE</span>: Go to our "Policies" page before contacting us. We are glad to have your business, but if you are prohibited from purchasing a firearm, WE CANNOT HELP YOU.</span>
						</p>
						
					<ol class="TransferSteps" type="A" start="9">
						<li> Pay our transfer fee. We accept CASH ONLY for transfers.</li>
